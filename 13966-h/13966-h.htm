    <h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

    <p>"Time to deal finally with Tino," announced an evening paper
    last week, thereby doing a great deal to allay a disquieting
    impression that the matter was to be left to eternity.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"KING CONSTANTINE," says the <i>Berliner Tageblatt</i>, "has
    as much right to be heard as a common criminal." We agree,
    though few of his friends have put it quite so bluntly.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The <i>Lokalanzeiger</i> devotes three columns of a recent
    issue to the advantages of the British blockade as a compulsory
    refiner of the German figure. A still more desirable feature of
    it, which the <i>Lokalanzeiger</i> omits to draw attention to,
    is its efficacy in reducing the German swelled head.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We know of no finer example of the humility of true
    greatness than the KAISER'S decision to allow the War to
    continue.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A Berlin newspaper says that after the coronation of the
    EMPEROR KARL at Budapest one of the jewels was missed from the
    Crown. Fortunately for the relations between the two Empires,
    the German CROWN PRINCE is in a position to prove an
    <i>alibi</i>.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>To facilitate the delivery of milk, a certain Dairymen's
    Association has suggested to the Food Controller that they
    should have recourse to a pool. In most districts, however,
    recourse will be had as usual to the pump.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Lord RHONNDA'S appeal to the public to keep tame rabbits has
    been enthusiastically taken up by all the smart people, and
    enterprising <i>maisons</i> are already offering driving coats,
    sleeping baskets and silk pyjamas for the little pets at prices
    ranging from two guineas upwards.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The tallest giraffe in the world has just died at the Zoo.
    The animal came from Kordofan, where, Mr. POCOCK tells us, all
    the really tall ones have been told.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is reported that General VON BISSING is retiring from
    Belgium as his health shows no signs of improvement. The blood
    baths he has been taking have not afforded the expected
    relief.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It was stated at a London Tribunal that the War Office has
    just given a contract for 2,400 waste-paper baskets. If further
    evidence was required of our unshakable determination to carry
    the War to a successful conclusion, it is surely provided by
    this indication of the extent to which the public are helping
    the War Office with suggestions as to how to win it.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Attention has been called to the waste of time and money
    involved in the calling of grand juries where there are only
    one or two trifling cases to be tried, and it is suggested that
    they might be able to combine their juridical functions with
    some useful employment. A correspondent who signs himself
    "Lifer" points out to us that the grand jurymen he has met are
    just the men the nation needs for the Tribunals if the
    combing-out process is to be effectual.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A man who was to have appeared before the Law Society
    Tribunal excused himself on the ground that he was suffering
    from melancholia, and regret was expressed by the military
    representative that he should have been misinformed as to the
    nature of the entertainment.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The admission of a Stuttgart professor that trousers are a
    German invention has given the liveliest satisfaction to our
    Highland regiments, who have long had an intuitive feeling that
    the Hun was guilty of even blacker crimes than those of which
    we had been officially informed.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A "Longer Course for Cadets" is announced by a morning
    paper. The Food Controller is to be asked to make public his
    reasons for this obviously unfair discrimination between
    soldiers.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Men's wear, it is reported, will be twenty-five per cent.
    dearer this year than last, but a good example in economy is
    rumoured to have been set by a well-known actor manager, who
    now only wears a crease in one leg of his trousers.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A burglar who broke into a Manchester wine stores made off
    with a large sum of money, but none of the wine was taken. This
    once again proves that total abstinence is absolutely essential
    to business success.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Consternation has been caused among the pessimists (who have
    declared that this will be a long War) by the recent statement
    of M. Louis RABOURDIN, the French scientist, that in five
    thousand years the world will be uninhabited.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A solicitor has been arrested in Ireland under the Defence
    of the Realm Act for refusing to give away the confidential
    correspondence of his client. The suggestion that a lawyer
    should be required to give away anything has aroused a storm of
    indignant protest in both branches of the profession.</p>

    <h4>"ARGENTINE MEAT SHIPMENTS.</h4>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The only shipment of mutton to the Continent during the
        week was 18,000 quarters of beef to
        France."&mdash;<i>Sheffield Daily Telegraph</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Even the oxen in neutral countries are feeling a little
    sheepish.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <blockquote>
        <p>"A large section of the city will find its water supply
        rather intermittent in consequence of a burst of the
        Rivington water main at Twig-lane, Huyton, near Prescot.
        The main has an internal diameter of forty-four
        miles."&mdash;<i>Liverpool Paper</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>What an awful bore!</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <blockquote>
        <p>"SEVENTEEN-YEAR LOCUSTS TO APPEAR NEXT SUMMER.</p>

        <p>State Collee, Pa, Dec. 11.&mdash;The 17-yearg lgocgugsgt
        is due to appear agagingg gnext summer, according to C.H.
        Hadley, Jr., an entomo-legeggggbmn TTMMggggob rr . . j Eas
        logist at the Pennsylvania State College."&mdash;<i>Erie
        Daily Times</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The news has had a decidedly discomposing effect
    already.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <blockquote>
        <p>"A gamble with death in the Strand&mdash;seeing that the
        stake is precisely the same&mdash;should be quite as
        enthralling as a hairbreadth 'scape on the plains of Texas,
        even though the gambler wears a top-hat instead of
        sheepskin trousers."&mdash;<i>Manchester Guardian</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The writer understates the case. The substitution of a
    top-hat for trousers would add a piquancy of its own to the
    situation.</p>

    <h2>RECOGNITION.</h2>

    <p>"Francesca," I said, "have you seen it?"</p>

    <p>"It? What?"</p>

    <p>"The announcement."</p>

    <p>"What announcement?"</p>

    <p>"I have been gazetted," I said.</p>

    <p>"Did it hurt much?" she said. "Or were you able to bear it
    without a murmur?"</p>

    <p>"It's in <i>The Times</i>," I said, "and you shall read it,
    whether you like it or not. It's in the place where I'm
    pointing my finger. There&mdash;do you see it?"</p>

    <p>"If you'd only take your finger away I might be able to.
    Thanks. My hat! isn't it exciting? 'To be 2nd Lieutenant
    (tempy.) 1st Battalion, Blankshire Regiment of
    Volunteers&mdash;' So it's come at last, has it?"</p>

    <p>"Yes," I said, "it's come at last. They've recognised
    us."</p>

    <p>"Well," she said, "it was about time, wasn't it? Here you've
    all been form-fouring and two deeping and route-marching for
    two years or so, and looking highly military in your grey-green
    uniforms, while the authorities stood by and persuaded
    themselves you didn't exist; and at last somebody comes
    along&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"It was Lord FRENCH who came along&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Yes," she said, "Lord FRENCH comes along on a fine cold
    Sunday morning and says to himself, 'Here are several hundred
    thousand men who are panting to make themselves useful. Let's
    recognise them," and from that moment you actually begin to
    exist. And then they bring down your grey hairs with sorrow
    into the Gazette, and, instead of being a Platoon Commander,
    you become a 2nd Lieutenant."</p>

    <p>"'Tempy,'" I said; "don't forget the 'tempy.'"</p>

    <p>"I won't," she said. "What does it mean? It sounds very
    irritable."</p>

    <p>"It does," I said; "but as a matter of fact it's got nothing
    to do with my temper. It means temporary."</p>

    <p>"Anyhow it's a difficult word to pronounce in four
    syllables. I shall do it in two."</p>

    <p>"No, Francesca, you shall not. As the holder of His
    Majesty's Commission I cannot allow you to go about the country
    saying tempy when you mean tem-po-ra-ry."</p>

    <p>"But why do they put in the word at all?"</p>

    <p>"It's the War Office way of announcing that we're not to
    expect our new-born joys to last for ever."</p>

    <p>"To the end of the War is long enough for most people at the
    present rate."</p>

    <p>"Do not let us peer too anxiously into the dim and distant
    future. Let us be satisfied with such a present as fate has
    assigned to us in making me a 2nd Lieutenant temporary, with
    all the privileges that the words imply."</p>

    <p>"Right," she said. "I'm going to wire to your brother Fred
    to come and stay here."</p>

    <p>"Do you want him to come and rejoice with us over my new
    rank?"</p>

    <p>"No," she said, "not exactly. I want to see how an elder
    brother, who is a 2nd Lieutenant temporary of Volunteers gets
    on with a younger brother who is a Colonel permanent in the
    real Army."</p>

    <p>"I do not," I said, "like the word 'real' There's a
    disagreeable invidiousness about it, and your mouth, you being
    what you are, should be the last to use it."</p>

    <p>'You'll have to salute him, you know."</p>

    <p>"Yes," I said, "I certainly shall when I'm in uniform."</p>

    <p>"And you'll have to call him 'Sir.'"</p>

    <p>"Nonsense."</p>

    <p>"You will," she said, "or you'll be court-martialled. And
    when he comes into a room in which you're sitting, you'll have
    to jump up and assume a rigid attitude until he's kind enough
    to wave his hand. Oh, it will be a real pleasure to have Fred
    here now that you've been thoroughly recognised. If you don't
    behave to him in a proper military manner you'll be reported to
    Lord FRENCH, and then you'll be more tempy than ever. Now that
    you're recognised you must do the thing thoroughly."</p>

    <p>"You'll be sorry for this when I'm guarding a railway line
    night and day."</p>

    <p>"No," she said, "I shan't. I shall keep you going with
    sandwiches and thermos-flasks."</p>

    <h2>THE MINIATURE.</h2>

    <p>When I left her, Celia had two photographs, a British warm
    and an accidental coffee-stain, by which to remember me. The
    coffee-stain was the purest accident. By her manner of
    receiving it, Celia gave me the impression that she thought I
    had done it on purpose, but it was not so. The coffee-cup
    slipped-in-me-'and-mum, after which the law of gravity stepped
    in, thus robbing what would have been a polite deed of most of
    its gallantry. However, I explained all that at the time. The
    fact remains that, in whatever way you look at it, I had left
    my mark. Celia was not likely to forget me.</p>

    <p>But she was determined to make sure. No doubt mine is an
    elusive personality; take the mind off it for one moment and it
    is gone. So I was to be perpetuated in a miniature.</p>

    <p>"Can it be done without a sitting?" I asked doubtfully. I
    was going away on the morrow.</p>

    <p>"Oh, yes. It can be done from the photographs easily. Of
    course I shall have to explain your complexion and so on."</p>

    <p>"May I read the letter when you've explained it?"</p>

    <p>"Certainly not," said Celia firmly.</p>

    <p>"I only want to make sure that it's an explanation and not
    an apology."</p>

    <p>"I shall probably put it down to a bicycle accident. Which
    is that?&mdash;No, no," she added hastily,
    "<i>Kamerad!</i>"</p>

    <p>I put down the revolver and went on with my packing. And a
    day or two later Celia began to write about the miniature.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The stars represent shells or months, or anything like that;
    <i>not</i> promotion. I came back with just the two&mdash;one
    on each sleeve.</p>

    <p>We talked of many things, but not of the miniature. Somehow
    I had forgotten all about it. And then one day I remembered
    suddenly.</p>

    <p>"The miniature," I said; "did you get it done?"</p>

    <p>"Yes," said Celia quietly.</p>

    <p>"Have you got it here?"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>"Oh, I say, do let me see it."</p>

    <p>Celia hesitated.</p>

    <p>"I think we had better wait till you are a little stronger,"
    she said very gently.</p>

    <p>"Is it so very beautiful?"</p>

    <p>"Well&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"So beautiful that it almost hurts? Celia, dear, let me risk
    it," I pleaded.</p>

    <p>She fetched it and gave it to me. I gazed at it a long
    time.</p>

    <p>"Who is it?" I asked at last.</p>

    <p>"I don't know, dear."</p>

    <p>"Is it like anybody we know?"</p>

    <p>"I think it's meant to be like <i>you</i>, darling," said
    Celia tenderly, trying to break it to me.</p>

    <p>I gazed at it again.</p>

    <p>"Would you get me a glass?" I asked her.</p>

    <p>"A looking-glass, or with brandy and things in it?"</p>

    <p>"Both ... Thank you. Promise me I don't look like this."</p>

    <p>"You don't," she said soothingly.</p>

    <p>"Then why didn't you tell the artist so and ask him to rub
    it out and do it again?"</p>

    <p>Celia sighed.</p>

    <p>"He has. The last was his third rubbige."</p>

    <p>Then another thing struck me.</p>

    <p>"I thought you weren't going to have it in uniform?"</p>

    <p>"I didn't at first. But we've been trying it in different
    costumes since to&mdash;to ease the face a little. It looked
    awful in mufti. Like a&mdash;a&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Go on," I said, nerving myself to it.</p>

    <p>"Like an uneasy choir-boy. I think I shall send it back
    again and ask him to put it in a surplice."</p>

    <p>"Yes, but why should my wife dangle a beneficed member of
    the Established Church of England round her neck? What proud
    prelate&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Choir-boy, darling. You're thinking of bishops."</p>

    <p>As it happened my thoughts were not at all episcopal. On the
    contrary, I looked at the miniature again, and I looked at
    myself in the glass, and I said firmly that the thing must go
    back a fourth time.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page037"

    <p>"You can't wear it. People would come and ask you who it was
    and you couldn't tell them. You'd have to keep it locked up,
    and what's the good of that?"</p>

    <p>"I <i>can't</i> write again," said Celia. "Poor man! Think
    of the trouble he's had. Besides I've got you back now. It was
    really just to remind me of you."</p>

    <p>"Yes, but I shall frequently be out to tea. You'd better
    have it done properly now."</p>

    <p>Celia was thoughtful. She began composing in her mind that
    fourth letter ... and frowning.</p>

    <p>"I know," she cried suddenly. "<i>You</i> write this
    time!"</p>

    <p>It was my turn to be thoughtful....</p>

    <p>"I don't see it. How do I come in? What is my <i>locus
    standi? Locus standi</i>," I explained in answer to her raised
    eyebrows, "an oath in common use among our Italian allies,
    meaning&mdash;What do I write as?"</p>

    <p>"As the owner of the face," said Celia in surprise.</p>

    <p>"Yes, but I can't dilate on my own face."</p>

    <p>"Why not?" said Celia, bubbling. "You know you'd love
    it."</p>

    <p>I looked at the miniature and began to think of possible
    openings. One impossible one struck me at once.</p>

    <p>"Anyway," I said, "I'll get him to close my mouth."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The stars represent something quite simple this
    time&mdash;my brain at work.</p>

    said, 'This is not like me,' I mean not like my
    husband&mdash;well, you know what I mean&mdash;just to condemn
    it is not enough. <i>I</i> shall do it differently. I shall
    take each feature separately and dwell upon it. But to do this
    modestly I must have a <i>locus</i>&mdash;I am sorry to have to
    borrow from our Italian allies again&mdash;a <i>locus
    standi</i> apart from that of owner of face. I must also be
    donor of miniature. Then I can comment impartially on the
    present which I am preparing for you."</p>

    <p>"I thought you'd see that soon," smiled Celia.</p>

    <h2>LETTERS FROM MACEDONIA.</h2>

    <h4>II.</h4>

    <p>MY DEAR JERRY,&mdash;No doubt you think from the
    light-hearted tone of my last letter that life here is a bed of
    roses. In reality we have our flies in the ointment&mdash;nay,
    our shirt-buttons in the soup. The chief of the flies is
    artillery, both our own and that of the people opposite; and
    the worst of the shirt-buttons is jam. It sounds strange, but
    it is true.</p>

    <p>There was a time in the olden days when we welcomed
    gunner-officers, but those days are unhappily past since we met
    Major Jones. Learn then the perfidy of the Major and <i>ex uno
    disce, omnes</i>.</p>

    <p>I had a nice little 'ouse up in the front line, well hidden
    by trees. It wasn't a <i>h</i>ouse, Jerry, I wish you to
    understand; it was merely a little 'ouse standing in its own
    grounds like, with a brace or so of chickens and a few
    mangel-wurzels a-climbin' round the place. You know what it's
    like.</p>

    <p>Well, Major Jones, who had been my guest several times in
    this little 'ouse of mine, came round a few days ago with a
    worried look and an orderly.</p>

    <p>"I want you to come and look at my telephone," he said
    hurriedly.</p>

    <p>"What is it? Is anything wrong?" I asked
    sympathetically.</p>

    <p>"I fear the worst. Something terrible may happen in five
    minutes," he replied darkly.</p>

    <p>I gripped his hand silently, and he returned the pressure
    with emotion. In silence we walked the two hundred yards which
    lay between my place and his observation post, and I watched
    while his orderly got busy with the telephone.</p>

    <p>"Is Number One gun ready?" demanded the Major.</p>

    <p>It appeared that Number One was itching to be at it.</p>

    <p>"Fire!" said the Major.</p>

    <p>"Fire!" said the orderly.</p>

    <p>A moment later there was a terrific explosion.</p>

    <p>"Number One fired, Sir," observed the orderly.</p>

    <p>"It is well you told us," I said sweetly, "otherwise I could
    never have believed it."</p>

    <p>But the Major heeded me not. He was staring over my
    shoulder.</p>

    <p>"Good shot, by Jove!" he yelled. "A perfect beauty! Holed
    out in one!"</p>

    <p>I turned to see what had caused his sudden joy. But where
    was my little 'ouse? Had <i>it</i> suddenly turned into that
    nasty cloud of dust? Even as I looked my water-bucket reached
    the ground again.</p>

    <p>"Awfully sorry, old man," said the Major, with a ghastly,
    pretence of sympathy. "You see it was in our way."</p>

    <p>I brushed aside his proffered hand (rather good that, Jerry.
    Let's have it again. I say I brushed aside his proffered hand),
    and strode back dismally to what had once been my home from
    home.</p>

    <p>Now I live in a little dug-out beneath the ground,
    chickenless and mangel-wurzelless, awaiting with resignation
    the day when the Sappers shall find that I am in <i>their</i>
    way and blow me up.</p>

    <p>Another little game of the gunners is called "Artillery
    Duels."</p>

    <p>In the good old days, when a man wanted a scrap with his
    neighbour, he put a double charge of powder into his
    blunderbuss, crammed in on top of it two horse-shoes, his
    latch-key, an old watch-chain, and a magnet, and then started
    on the trail. It was very effective, but of course some
    busy-body "improved" on it. Nowadays our gunners ring up the
    enemy's artillery.</p>

    <p>"Hallo! Is that you, strafe you? What about an artillery
    duel, eh?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, what fun!" says the enemy. "Do let's." And then they
    start.</p>

    <p>"A hearty give-and-take, that's what I like," remarks a
    cheery gunner officer.</p>

    <p>A moment later he rushes to the telephone.</p>

    <p>"Is that you, enemy?" he asks. "I say, dash it all, old man,
    do be careful! That last one of yours was jolly near my
    favourite gun."</p>

    <p>"By Jove, I'm awfully sorry, old thing," calls back the
    enemy. "What about shortening the fuses a bit, eh?"</p>

    <p>"Good idea! Waken up the foot-sloggers too. They need it
    sometimes."</p>

    <p>Then for fifteen minutes large shells rebound from the bowed
    head and shoulders of the unfortunate infantryman.</p>

    <p>Which reminds me of George.</p>

    <p>George had a strafe-proof waistcoat procured by him from a
    French manufacturer. He showed it to us proudly, and also the
    advertisement, which stated that the waistcoat would easily
    stop a rifle-bullet, whilst a "45" would simply bounce off it.
    It was beautiful but alarming to see his confidence as he stood
    up in a shower of shells, praying for a chance of showing off
    the virtues of his acquisition.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We were very pleased to send to his hospital address to-day
    a postcard bearing the maker's explanation that a .45 revolver
    bullet, and <i>not</i> a 45 millimetre shell, was meant.</p>

    <p>As regards the jam question, Jerry, the fault of the jam is
    that it is never jam, but always marmalade. I feel too sore on
    the question to write much, but I may just hint that we have
    heard that Brother Bulgar sometimes gets real strawberry. It is
    just possible, therefore, that you may hear of a raid soon.</p>

    <h2>PETHERTON AND THE PLURALIST.</h2>

    <p>"Hello!" I said, "a note from Petherton. What can my
    charming neighbour want now?"</p>

    <p>The letter ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;I find that George, the young man I employ as
    house-boy, has become friendly with one of your maids, and I
    shall he glad if you will co-operate with me so far as is
    possible in trying to prevent their meeting, as I do not think
    it desirable that there should be further communication between
    our households than is, unfortunately, necessary.</p>

    <p>I should not have troubled to write to you had it not been
    that George strongly resented my interference with his private
    affairs when I remonstrated with him just now on the matter.
    Servants are so deplorably independent in these times, and men
    as useful as George are so difficult to obtain, that I do not
    care to open the subject with him again.</p>

    <p>The maid of yours in question is the one who goes out on
    Wednesday evenings. As that is also George's evening out,
    perhaps you could arrange to let this particular maid go out on
    another evening instead.</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Faithfully yours,</p>

            <p>FREDERICK PETHERTON.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>"What confounded sauce!" I said, and replied formally as
    follows:&mdash;</p>

    <p>DEAR MR. PETHERTON,&mdash;It must, I am sure, be most
    alarming to you to find that servants of ours are hobnobbing
    and perhaps discussing our affairs. Unfortunately to make the
    alteration you suggest would throw the whole of our domestic
    staff out. I know the maid to whom you refer; she is our
    parlour-maid, and you are right in describing her as "this
    particular maid." She is most particular. It is true that men
    are hard to obtain for domestic employment, even ineligibles
    (and I am sure yours is that), but maids are, if anything, more
    difficult to find. My wife had no end of trouble in procuring
    this parlour-maid, and she is a treasure whom we do not wish to
    lose.</p>

    <p>I have been aware for some time that she is engaged in the
    pleasurable occupation of what is known as keeping company with
    your factotum, but thought it wise not to interfere.</p>

    <p>It is still in the air, as one might say, that you are
    engaged in experimental chemical work for the Government, and I
    should have thought, and hoped, that this would occupy your
    mind to the exclusion of such trivial affairs as servants'
    love-making.</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

            <p>HENRY J. FORDYCE.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Petherton quickly countered with:&mdash;</p>

    <p>SIR&mdash;I am sorry that I should have appealed to you in
    vain. It is not a pleasure to write to you, and it is
    positively distasteful to have to read your absurd letters in
    reply. I passed George in the village this evening with his arm
    round your parlour-maid's waist. I was absolutely disgusted,
    and must emphatically protest against such familiarity even
    among the minor members of our households.</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Faithfully yours,</p>

            <p>FREDERICK PETHERTON.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Joyously I rushed to respond:&mdash;</p>

    <p>DEAR PETHERTON,&mdash;Your letters, on the contrary, are a
    positive delight to me. One of the reasons why I should not
    like to interfere is the feeling that it might put an end to
    our correspondence.</p>

    <p>Personally I cannot visualize the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page043"
       id="page043"></a>[pg 43]</span> spectacle of similar
       familiarity between any of the major members of our
       respective households.</p>

    <p>I myself passed your man this evening as I was on my way to
    the Vicarage, and at the moment he was in mild dalliance with
    our housemaid. I say mild because they were only arm-in-arm. On
    my return about an hour later I passed George again, and it is
    true that this time he was with our parlour-maid, and had his
    arm round her waist as you describe.</p>

    <p>There is no doubt that the young man has a penchant for my
    staff, but so far no Government secrets have reached my ears,
    and no details of your personal doings, past, present or
    future.</p>

    <p>"Carry on" is the motto of the day, so why not let well
    alone? Were you never a young man?</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Ever yours,</p>

            <p>HARRY FORDYCE.</p>
        </div>
    </div>


    <p>Petherton was getting very worked-up, to judge from his
    reply:&mdash;</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;I disapprove of your levity. This is a serious
    matter to me. On your own showing George's behaviour is
    scandalous, and although I should scarcely expect you to look
    at the matter in its proper light I should have thought that
    even you would have interfered now that matters have reached
    such a state. Your attitude is intolerable.</p>

    <p>I am well able to protect the Government's secrets, and my
    movements could be of little interest even to you, but I do not
    think the society of your maids desirable for a young man like
    George. I strongly suspect that they are having a bad influence
    over him. He is becoming careless in his work.</p>

    <p>I accidentally overheard him say, in conversation with the
    grocer's man, that he was&mdash;to use his own
    expression&mdash;walking out with a Miss Parsons. Is this
    either your parlour-maid or housemaid? or is it some third
    person?</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Yours faithfully,</p>

            <p>FREDERICK PETHERTON.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>DEAR OLD CHAP (I replied),&mdash;Thank you for your cheering
    letter. I hope neither of us will say or do anything that would
    terminate this exchange of letters, which is keeping me from
    dwelling too much on the War.</p>

    <p>Miss Parsons is our cook, as worthy a young woman as ever
    riveted an apple-dumpling or tossed a custard. She would make
    George an excellent wife. Don't worry about the parlour-maid or
    housemaid. They would, I am sure, be delighted to be at the
    wedding.</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Yours,</p>

            <p>HARRY.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Petherton's reply was prompt, personal and to the
    point:&mdash;</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;Confound you and your entire staff! You ought all
    to be interned. If George ever thinks of leaving me I trust it
    will not be to marry one of your household. In the name of
    decency I must insist on your taking strong action to end what
    is a positive scandal.</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Faithfully yours,</p>

            <p>FREDERICK PETHERTON.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>It was Monday before I replied, then I wrote:&mdash;</p>

    <p>DEAR FREDDY,&mdash;Let us mingle our tears. The worst is
    about to happen If you were as good a churchgoer as one could
    wish, you would have been in your pew yesterday morning, when
    the banns were read out (for the first time of asking) "between
    George Goodman, bachelor, and Emily Parsons, spinster, both of
    this parish," though this would not have conveyed to you the
    appalling fact that your man is marrying my entire staff all at
    once. I doubt, however, if you will be able to find cause or
    just impediment, <i>etc.</i></p>

    <h2>THE FOLLOW-UP METHOD.</h2>

    <p>When you respond to an advertisement offering a booklet or a
    sample free, you are pestered by the proprietor of the
    commodity advertised with numerous communications importuning
    your custom, until in sheer self-defence you make a purchase.
    Now I had occasion to answer an announcement advertising for
    the services of a person with attainments approximating to my
    own, decided that, in the event of my application attracting no
    response, I would adopt the methods indicated above. For the
    benefit of others I give below a record of my procedure and the
    result.</p>

    <p>My first letter detailed my qualifications, which were very
    exceptional; explained that my intelligence and industry were
    far above the average; that I was morbidly conscientious, and
    willing to sacrifice all my own interests for the needs of the
    firm; that the reason for leaving my last position was solely a
    matter of circumstances over which I had no control, and that
    at an interview, which I craved, I would explain everything to
    everybody's satisfaction and prove my perfect eligibility for
    the post. And so forth.</p>

    <p>I waited a fortnight. There was no reply. I therefore
    despatched a follow-up letter. I explained my regret at
    receiving no response to letter No. 1, and suggested that
    perhaps it had been inadvertently overlooked, or had gone
    astray in transit. Alternatively I hinted that perhaps the firm
    regarded the list of my qualifications as incredibly
    pretentious, and I assured them that it in no way exaggerated
    my good points. I had indeed become, if possible, even more
    conscientious and industrious since I had last written, and
    having recovered from a cold in the head from which I was then
    suffering I was actually in better physical condition than
    before. I reminded the firm that in granting me a preliminary
    interview they incurred no liability whatsoever.</p>

    <p>Another two weeks went by, and still no answer. So I
    despatched Follow-up Letter No. 2.</p>

    <p>This briefly referred to my two previous communications, and
    asked whether it was not clear to them that, by securing my
    services while I was in possession of all my faculties and the
    full vigour and strength of my being, there were advantages
    they could not possibly acquire with me in, say, another thirty
    years, when I should probably be suffering from rheumatism,
    chronic dyspepsia, deafness, dim sight, loss of memory and
    certainly from approaching old age. I concluded by offering
    them three days' free trial (I always do best in the first
    three days); if I failed to give satisfaction by the end of
    that period they could return me without incurring any
    obligation whatsoever.</p>

    <p>Again two weeks passed away, and there was still no answer.
    So I sent Follow-up Letter No. 3.</p>

    <p>In this I announced a Special Offer, viz., a reduction of
    twenty pounds sterling (&pound;20) on the salary originally
    asked if the firm engaged me within ten days from the date of
    the offer.</p>

    <p>I gave them twelve days in which to respond, but still
    received no answer, so, after allowing a further two days'
    grace, I despatched Follow-up Letter No. 4, stating that as
    they had evidently been prevented from replying to my special
    offer I had decided to extend the period for acceptance by
    fourteen (14) days, reckoning from the date of the present
    communication. At the end of that period the salary demanded
    would be increased by ten pounds (&pound;10) over and above
    that asked in my <i>first</i> application. Thus, by accepting
    the existing offer of twenty pounds (&pound;20) reduction, they
    would really be securing me at thirty pounds (&pound;30) less
    than my market price.</p>

    <p>I waited patiently for a further fourteen days, and then
    sent Follow-up Letter No. 5.</p>

    <p>This letter was quite brief. It made no attempt to disguise
    the fact that I was hurt at the firm's silence, and it hinted
    at enquiries from other employers of labour whose needs would
    have to be considered. It intimated also that I could not
    possibly hold myself at the firm's disposal indefinitely, and
    that unless a prompt reply was received I could not guarantee
    acceptance. By way of a crushing suggestion of niggardliness on
    their part I enclosed a stamped addressed envelope.</p>

    <p>An answer came by return of post as follows:&mdash;</p>

    <p>DEAR SIR,&mdash;In reply to your letter, we beg to say that
    the vacancy to which you refer was filled some ten (10) weeks
    ago.</p>

    <p>Yours faithfully, <i>etc.</i></p>

    <p>Now I know where I am. Without this persistence, which is
    the essence of the following-up business, I should simply be
    where I am without knowing it.</p>

    <h3>THE QUEST OF KNOWLEDGE.</h3>

    <p>MR. BLAIR, the L.C.C. Education Officer, is dissatisfied,
    according to <i>The Daily Chronicle</i>, with the questions put
    at school examinations, on the ground that they do not test the
    thoughtfulness and ingenuity of the pupil. The "Why" as well as
    the "What" should be developed, and to illustrate the value of
    the method proposed Mr. BLAIR suggests various sample
    questions, <i>e.g.</i>:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"How do you account for the density of the population in
    Staffordshire?</p>

    <p>"Find out from your atlas the distance from London to
    Glasgow. How long would it take you to go there by train? What
    would the third-class fare be at a penny a mile?</p>

    <p>"How can we discover the minimum conditions necessary for
    the germination of a bean?</p>

    <p>"ARISTOTLE remarked that a bee will visit one type of flower
    only during one journey from the hive. Find out if this is
    true, and, if true, point out its significance from the point
    of view of the flower."</p>

    <p>As Mr. BLAIR remarks, a quest is better than a question. We
    agree, and venture to start a few more quests:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Find out from <i>Who's Who</i> the literary productions of
    Miss MARIE CORELLI and Mr. HALL CAINE, and trace their effect
    on the density of the population of Warwickshire and the Isle
    of Man respectively.</p>

    <p>"ARISTOTLE remarked that one swallow does not make a summer.
    Find out whether this is true, and, if true, explain its
    bearing on the thirst of the swallower.</p>

    <p>"Find out on your map the distance from Madrid to Jaffa, and
    state what would be the cost of a cargo of Spanish onions and
    Jerusalem artichokes delivered in the London Docks.</p>

    <p>"What is the minimum time necessary for the incubation of a
    Scarlet Pimpernel?</p>

    <p>What are the statutory dimensions of a gigantic gooseberry?
    Have you ever seen one, and if not why not?"</p>

    <h2>MISGIVINGS.</h2>

    <p>Walking recently by Hyde Park Corner I met a man in a comic
    hat. He was an elderly man, very well set up, marching along
    like an old officer&mdash;quite an impressive figure with his
    grey moustache and grey hair, had not this ridiculous affair
    surmounted him. It was not exactly a hat, and not exactly a
    cap, but something between the two, and it was so minute as to
    be almost invisible and wholly absurd. Yet there was every
    indication that its wearer believed that it suited him, for he
    moved both with confidence and self-satisfaction.</p>

    <p>And as I watched him, and after he had passed, swinging his
    stick and surveying the world with the calm assurance of a
    connoisseur of most of the branches of life I began to
    entertain some very serious and disturbing doubts. For (thought
    I) here is quite a capable kind of fellow, of mature age,
    making a perfect guy of himself under the profound conviction
    that he is doing just the reverse and that that pimple of a hat
    suits him. No doubt, judging by the cut of his clothes and his
    general <i>soign&eacute;</i> appearance, he stands before his
    glass every morning until he is satisfied. Had he (thought I)
    any accuracy of vision he would see himself the grotesque thing
    he is in that idiotic little cap. But his vision is
    distorted.</p>

    <p>It was then that I began to go hot and cold all over, for I
    suddenly realised that my vision might be distorted too. My hat
    hitherto had satisfied me; but suppose that that too was all
    wrong. And then I wondered if anyone really gets a true return
    from the mirror, or if we are not all bemused; and, remembering
    those astounding hats in which WINSTON used to be photographed
    a few years ago, I asked myself, "Where are <i>we</i>, when
    even the great legislators can go so wrong?"</p>

    <p>Although all this soul-searching occurred several days ago,
    I am still nervous, and I never catch sight of my reflection in
    a shop window without suspicion racking me; while to see a
    smile on the face of an approaching pedestrian is agony.</p>

    <p>But (you will say) why not ask the hatter or some intimate
    friend to select the hat for you? I guessed you would suggest
    that. But it won't help; I'll tell you why. Some years ago I
    knew a fat man with a big head&mdash;a journalist of great
    ability&mdash;who made himself undignified by perching upon the
    top of that great and capable head a little bowler. Its
    inadequacy had always annoyed me, but never more so than when,
    on my arriving at our place of servitude one morning (we were
    on the same paper) in a new and perfectly becoming hat, he said
    to me, "That hat's all wrong. You should never choose a hat for
    yourself. I <i>never</i> do. I get my wife to choose mine for
    me." Remembering this I am even more unsettled than before. I
    see no hope.</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks</i>.)</h4>

    <p>The idea of publishing <i>Frederick the Great: The Memoirs
    of his Reader, Henri de Catt</i> (<i>1758-1760</i>) (CONSTABLE)
    was that we are all so passionate against Prussianism that we
    want to plank down our money for two volumesful of observations
    at first hand about the man who was the source and origin of
    that dark and swollen stream. Personally, we doubt the general
    zeal in this matter&mdash;not of Prussianism but of FREDERICK.
    However, DE CATT, looking at a king from a queer angle, is
    extraordinarily diverting. "Reader" was a euphemism for a
    patient audience, including <i>claque</i>. FREDERICK,
    <i>incognito</i> on a Dutch barge, picked up the young scholar
    and marked him down as one who could be induced by florins and
    flattery to take on the job of listening to his patron's bad
    French verses and his after-dinner flutings of little things of
    his own, his approving observations on his own conduct, his
    battles, his philosophy of life and politics, no doubt
    calculating that it would all be jotted down on fateful scraps
    of paper and given a favourable colouring for the edification
    of the world. Well, the great FREDERICK put it over me all
    right. Frankly I rather liked the old fellow, his old clothes
    (there was at least no shining armour swank at Potsdam in those
    days), his practice of solemnly cutting capers for the benefit
    of his "reader," though I know not explicitly what a caper is,
    his Billingsgate language, his real opinion of VOLTAIRE, his
    charming, if possibly rare, acts of magnanimity, his moderation
    in war, which was not all hypocrisy. In fact, if you expect an
    ogre you will be disappointed. He could give the latest
    Hohenzollern points in a good many directions. I ought, of
    course, to add that a learnedly allusive preface by Lord
    ROSEBERY graces the volume, and that the very competent
    translation is by F.S. FLINT.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>These are days when the more we know about Russia and things
    Russian the better. Specially timely, then, is the appearance,
    in an English translation, of <i>The Fishermen</i> (STANLEY
    PAUL), by DIMITRY GREGOROVITSH. It is a wonderfully appealing
    story, which has been put into English&mdash;presumably by Dr.
    ANGELO RAPPOPORT, though he is only credited on the title-page
    with the authorship of the Preface&mdash;in such a way that the
    spirit of the original is admirably preserved. I had not read a
    couple of pages before the charm of the style laid hold upon
    me. The story is quite simple, concerned only with a group of
    peasants, fisher-folk, living on the banks of a great river.
    GREGOROVITSH is like TOURGENIEV in his devotion to peasant and
    country types, but otherwise more akin to our own younger
    school of realists in the minuteness of his observation.
    Throughout the story abounds in character-study of a kind that,
    while building up the figure with a thousand details, will add
    suddenly some vivid touch that brings the whole wonderfully and
    unforgettably to life. An example of this is <i>Akim</i>, that
    perfect type of the hopeless incompetent, whose very futility,
    while it rightly exasperates his fellows, makes him a delight
    to the reader; so that his death, at the end of the first part,
    comes with an effect of personal loss. For my own part, as poor
    <i>Akim</i> had never once before
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page086"
       id="page086"></a>[pg 086]</span> accomplished what he set
       out to do, I was quite expectant of his recovery, and
       proportionately disappointed. Throughout also there are
       pen-pictures of Russian scenery, full of vivid colour; while
       the story itself, though inevitably in a somewhat minor key,
       is never sordid or pessimistic. Emphatically therefore a
       book for everyone to read who cares to know the best in the
       literature of our great Ally.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>MARGARET DELAND'S well-proved pen gives us a spirited sketch
    of a modernist American woman in <i>The Rising Tide</i>
    (MURRAY). I don't quite know how this enigmatic sentence, which
    1 have long puzzled over and frankly given up, came to escape
    both author and reader: "Once Mrs. Childs said to tell Fred her
    Uncle William would say it was perfect nonsense." I feel sure
    it is not good American. However, <i>Freddy Payton</i> is a
    young girl who tells the inconvenient truth to everybody about
    everything, and you may guess that such candour does not make
    for peace. <i>Mrs. Payton</i> elects to keep her idiot son in
    the house, and <i>Freddy</i> thinks an asylum is the proper
    place for him, and says so. The late <i>Mr. Payton</i> was a
    rake, and <i>Freddy</i> derides her mother's weeds on the
    ground that the widow is really in her heart waving flags for
    deliverance, but daren't admit it. <i>Freddy</i> offers
    cigarettes to the curate, which is apparently a much greater
    crime over there than here. <i>Freddy</i> finally, carried
    along by the rising tide, asks the man she loves to marry her,
    mistaking his friendship for something stronger, and learns
    that, as the old-fashioned people like her mother realise, men
    are essentially hunters and "won't bag the game if it perches
    on their fists." I wonder! But <i>Freddy</i> got a better
    man&mdash;the diffident elderly man who was waiting round the
    corner. In fact, <i>Freddy</i> is rather a sport, and if Mrs.
    DELAND intended her as a tract for the times, in the manner of
    Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD, her shot has miscarried&mdash;at least so
    far as I am concerned.</p>

        BETRAYED HIMSELF.

    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>Edmund Layton</i>, thick in the arm and at times, be it
    confessed, thick in the head, was so thoroughly in love with
    <i>The Bright Eyes of Danger</i> (CHAMBERS), and the brighter
    eyes of <i>Charlotte Macdonell</i>, Jacobitess, that in the
    rousing days of the YOUNG PRETENDER he not only lightly risked
    his life when his lady was in need, but more than once went out
    of his way to make things quite unnecessarily hazardous for
    himself, when I or any other of his more canny Hanoverian
    friends was longing to give him warning. For instance, when
    that taking villain, <i>Philip Macdonell</i>, after beating him
    in the race for the French treasure buried in the sands of Spey
    beside the sunken ship (<i>vide</i> the frontispiece mystery
    chart), soon after fell comfortably into his hands, he had no
    more discretion than to take him out to fight a duel; whereon,
    as we others foresaw, the wily villain incontinently
    disappeared and the fun was all to begin again. Maybe we might
    forgive him that, for of such staple are good yarns spun, but
    why in heaven's name should bold <i>Edmund Layton</i> of
    Liddesdale go about to make himself and us miserable with
    feckless scruples that ruined the happy ending we had fairly
    earned? Either he was right to let CHARLES STUART escape that
    day in the mist, in return for former generosity, or he was
    wrong; and one would have expected him to make up his mind and
    there an end, and not fret himself into a pother and Mr. JOHN
    FOSTER'S story into a most inartistic anti-climax over such a
    subtlety. All the same a rattling good tale, full of hard
    knocks as well as bright eyes, and with more than a smack of
    STEVENSON.</p>

    <p>I fancy that I ought perhaps already to know <i>The
    Wood-Carver of 'Lympus</i> (MELROSE), which, hailing originally
    from America, seems to have made many friends over here before
    reaching me in its present form. I am glad, more especially at
    the present season, to extend a grateful welcome to so kindly
    and charming a story. Miss MARY E. WALLER has written a
    singularly refreshing and happy book, full of passages that
    reveal a great sympathy for country life and the hearts of
    simple people. <i>Hugh Armstrong</i>, the central figure, is a
    youth in a New England mountain farm, condemned to perpetual
    inactivity through an accident. At the beginning of the story
    we see him, in the depths of misery, visited by a casual
    passenger from the stage coach, whose attention has been caught
    by his story as related by the driver. Thenceforward things
    mend for <i>Armstrong</i>. The stranger interests him in
    wood-carving; orders pour in, which help to bring comfort to
    the farm; books and letters arrive from unknown city dwellers.
    Thus the tale is a record of increasing happiness, but kept (an
    important thing) from cloying by the tragedy upon which it is
    built. If you will not be put off by American dialect or by the
    rather startling discovery that one of the kindliest characters
    is named <i>Franz</i>, you will, I believe, find a brief stay
    upon '<i>Lympus</i> most beneficial to your spirits.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
